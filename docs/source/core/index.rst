Core objects
============

A set of core JSON classes used in ``amorphys`` is described here.

The three key concepts in ``amorphys`` are:

1. **Entity**: represents a physical existence.
2. **Relationship**: represents a relationship between two Entity instances.
3. **Context**: represents a group of Entities and Relationships.

In addition, several supportive classes are defined to facilitate annotation;
refer to :doc:`referrable`, :doc:`measurements`, :doc:`protocol-control` and :doc:`variable`.

Core objects
============

A set of core JSON classes used in ``amorphys`` is described here.

The three key concepts in ``amorphys`` are:

1. **Entity**: represents a physical existence.
2. **Relationship**: represents a relationship between two Entity instances.
3. **Context**: represents a group of Entities and Relationships.

In addition, :doc:`referrable` is defined to facilitate annotation.
